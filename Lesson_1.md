# Lesson 1
## Accesing IDLE
IDLE is a built-in software with python that allows you to write and execute code.  
To find IDLE in Mac OS:  
  * Open your terminal.
  * Simply type **idle** into your terminal.
  * A rocket icon should show up as IDLE loads.

To find IDLE in Windows:  
  * Press the search icon at the bottom left of your screen.
  * Start typing **idle** into it.    

## Using IDLE
Once idle has loaded, you should see a window like the image below called **Python 3.x.x Shell**, where 3.x.x is your version of python.

This window that we are in now is called the **Shell Window**. This windowis useful for testing quick pieces of code. Here code is executed the moment you press enter. Let's try it! Your first line of code! 
Type the code below and press enter
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
Your window should look something like this:

Congrats! You just wrote your first line of code! Here's how it works.  
The **print()** command is a fuction, a pre writtern bit of code, in python that justs print's the thing that's inside the brackets to the screen. Make sure that if you are typing letters into the **print()**, the letters are surrounded by either single('') or double("") quotation marks. 
If it didn't work then you most likely got some red text saying somethng along the lines of:  
```python
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```  
This is a type of error in python. This paticular error means that you have typed something wrong. Syntax is the combination of spelling and punctuation that a computer can understand. Check and make sure the code you have written matches **exactly** to what I put above.  

## Saving your code
The shell window is good for testing small peices of code but you can't save anything in it. To be able to do this you need something called a **code window**. I will now go through the steps to save your code.  

1. Click on file at the top of the shell window and select **New File**. A code window will now open up.  
2. Click on file at the top of your Code Window select **Save As**. Name the file **Hello World.py**. **.py** tells the computer that the file is a python file. Save the file in a central location you can find easily.  
3. Go back to your code window and type in...  
```python
print("Hello World!")
```  
...just as we did before.  
4. Click on file again and click **save**.  
5. Click on **run** and select **Run module**. In this instance, **module** means python file.  
6. The Shell window should then open up and the words **Hello World!** should appear.  

## Numbers in python  
### Adding in python  
Open/go back to the shell window and type and press enter: 
'''python
4 + 4
'''  
You should see the shell window output:  

### Subtracting in python  
Type and press enter: 
```python
8 - 4
```  
You should see the shell window output: 

### Dividing in python  
Type and press enter: 
```python
8 / 4
```  
You should see the shell window output: 
Notice how we don't use the standard **รท** symbol. In python and computer science in general we don't use the normal divide sign but the **/** sign.

### Multiplying in python  
Type and press enter:  
```python
2 * 2
```   
You should see the shell window output:  
Notice how we don't use the standard **x** symbol. In python and computer science in general we don't use the normal divide sign but the **'*'** sign.  

### Equals sign 
In python, we don't use **=** for maths but for a different purpose that will be answered in a moment.  

## Variables  
Variables are like a named boxes where you can store information. You can change this information but the label stays the same.
