# Lesson 1
### Accesing IDLE
IDLE is a built-in software with python that allows you to write and execute code.  
To find IDLE in Mac OS:  
  * Open your terminal.
  * Simply type **idle** into your terminal.
  * A rocket icon should show up as IDLE loads.

To find IDLE in Windows:  
  * Press the search icon at the bottom left of your screen.
  * Start typing **idle** into it.    

### Using IDLE
Once idle has loaded, you should see a window like the image below called **Python 3.x.x Shell**, where 3.x.x is your version of python.

This window that we are in now is called the **Shell Window**. This windowis useful for testing quick pieces of code. Here code is executed the moment you press enter. Let's try it! Your first line of code! 
Type the code below and press enter
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
Your window should look something like this:

Congrats! You just wrote your first line of code! Here's how it works.  
The **print()** command is a fuction, a pre writtern bit of code, in python that justs print's the thing that's inside the brackets to the screen. Make sure that if you are typing letters into the **print()**, the letters are surrounded by either single('') or double("") quotation marks. 
If it didn't work then you most likely got some red text saying somethng along the lines of:  
```python
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```  
This is a type of error in python. This paticular error means that you have typed something wrong. Check and make sure the code you have written matches **exactly** to what I put above.
