# Lesson 1
### Accesing IDLE
IDLE is a built-in software with python that allows you to write and execute code.  
To find IDLE in Mac OS:  
  * Open your terminal.
  * Simply type **idle** into your terminal.
  * A rocket icon should show up as IDLE loads.

To find IDLE in Windows:  
  * Press the search icon at the bottom left of your screen.
  * Start typing **idle** into it.    

### Using IDLE
Once idle has loaded, you should see a window like the image below called **Python 3.x.x Shell**, where 3.x.x is your version of python.

This is where we will spend the next few lessons coding in :).  

This window that we are in now is called the **Shell Window**. Here code is executed the moment you press enter. Let's try it! Your first line of code! 
Type the code below and press enter
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
Your window should look something like this:

Congrats! You just wrote your first line of code! Here's how it works.  
The **print()** function in python justs print's the thing that's inside the bracket. Make sure that if you are typing letters into the **print()**, the letters are surrounded by either single('') or double("") quotation marks. 
If it didn't work then you most likely got some red text saying somethng along the lines of:  
```python
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```
